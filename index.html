<p>I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist with interests in auditory and audiovisual processing, psychophysics, linguistics, statistics, signal processing, and machine learning. Past experiments have focused on cortical processing of complex synthetic speech sounds, the psychophysics of signal discrimination, audiovisual approximations to speech, and auditory processing in clinical and control populations. Analysis of the data generated is done in R, Julia, MATLAB, and Python.  </p>

<p>My other major analysis/programming interest is data science. Ongoing projects include creating and visualizing complex statistical model fits in R, using Python for data munging and visualization of large, multivariate datasets, and porting analyses between R, Python and Julia (where possible). Current and upcoming projects include re-analysis of published data; comparing statistical model output between R and Julia; election simulations in Python and Julia, among others. Other topics that interest me are Natural Language Processing, Bayesian statistics, and classification/prediction problems applied to experimental and multivariate datasets.  </p>

<p>Applications:  </p>

<ul>
<li>applying linear regression, Generalized Linear Models, and (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models to clinical, neuroimaging, and psychophysical data (and experimental data in general)<br>
</li>
<li>clustering and classification of clinical and experimental groups based on demographic information and neuronal responses<br>
</li>
<li>analysis of discrimination and perception in neuronal and behavioral responses<br>
</li>
<li>applying Bayesian analysis to observed neuronal and experimental responses and model fit values<br>

</ul>
