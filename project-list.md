# Data science projects

## Election simulations in Python and Julia
Retroactive simulations/analyses for the 2012 US Presidential electionl. Developed primarily from the ['Desperately Seeking Silver'](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/HW2.ipynb) homework and tutorial. Python (`SciPy`, `NumPy`, `pandas`) and Julia (`DataFrames`, `GLM`) used to create simulate outcomes. Working on extending to other methods and elections.
